## Class Features

This library may be consumed in your project in order to automate the fulfillment of requests, this class once imported into your project will allow you to:

- Connect to Connect using your api credentials
- List all requests, and even filter them:
    - for a Concrete product
    - for a concrete status
- Process each request and obtain full details of the request
- Modify for each request the activation parameters in order to:
    - Inquiry for changes
    - Store information into the fulfillment request
- Change the status of the requests from it's initial pending state to either inquiring, failed or approved.
- Generate logs
- Collect debug logs in case of failure
